Week 1: Planning and Initial Setup

Day 1-2: Project Setup and Architecture Design

Set up the project in Visual Studio using .NET MAUI.

Define the project structure following the MVVM pattern.

Outline key components: UI, camera integration, machine learning (ML), server communication, and data storage.


Day 3-4: UI Wireframe and Design

Sketch the initial UI design: a live camera feed, controls for starting/stopping road monitoring, and a list of reported potholes.

Start building the basic UI in .NET MAUI using XAML and data binding principles.


Day 5: Camera Integration Research

Research how to access the camera in .NET MAUI. Familiarize yourself with available libraries or APIs to handle live video feed.
